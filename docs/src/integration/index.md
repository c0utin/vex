# Integration Guide

VEX is designed to be highly flexible, allowing integration with both traditional web applications (Web2) and decentralized applications on the Internet Computer (Web3). This section provides detailed guidance on how to integrate VEX into different application environments.

## Integration Options

VEX offers several integration options to meet your specific needs:

### 1. Full Stack Integration

Deploy your own VEX canister on the Internet Computer and integrate the VEX client library into your frontend application. This option provides maximum control and customization.

### 2. Client-Only Integration

Use our hosted VEX canister service and integrate only the client library into your application. This option is ideal for quick implementation without managing infrastructure.

### 3. API Integration

Interact with VEX through its Candid interface directly. This option is suitable for applications that need to communicate with VEX at a lower level.

## Integration Guides

We provide detailed guides for different integration scenarios:

- [Web2 Integration](./web2.md) - Integrate VEX with traditional web applications
- [ICP Dapps Integration](./icp-dapps.md) - Integrate VEX with Internet Computer dapps
- [Authentication](./authentication.md) - Set up authentication for your VEX integration

## Common Integration Patterns

Here are some common integration patterns:

### Support Portal

Implement a complete support portal where users can create and manage support tickets.

### In-App Support Widget

Add a floating support widget to your application that allows users to create tickets without leaving the current page.

### Admin Dashboard

Create an administrative dashboard for support agents to manage and respond to tickets.

### API-Only Backend

Use VEX as a backend service for your custom support interface.

## Integration Considerations

When integrating VEX, consider the following:

1. **Authentication**: How will users authenticate with your application and VEX?
2. **Data Flow**: How will data flow between your application and VEX?
3. **User Experience**: How will the support experience be integrated into your application's UI?
4. **Customization**: What aspects of VEX do you need to customize for your specific use case?
